When I first starting thinking about writing my blog about the process of learning to code, I immediately thought of the quintessential cookbook *Mastering the Art of French Cooking* by the incomparable Julia Child. As a spy turned housewife turned world-renowned celebrity, Julia Child was inspiring. Truly, here was a woman who knew what she wanted and wasn't afraid to go and get it. Despite her considerable size, both in stature and personality, the ex-pat's unselfish mantra was that "anyone can cook!"

Anyone can code!

When I first started to learn to code, it was easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of material I had yet to tackle. I was inspired, excited to get started, but easily sidetracked. I was worried that I would break my computer just by installing Atom. Linking my Github account felt like a weighty triumph, especially considering all of the blogposts tauting the necessity getting involved with open-source projects to build a resume. I would catch myself peeking down rabbitholes on StackOverflow after searching for an explanation of a test failure. I spent more time on Ruby-Doc than I wanted to allow myself - was there a difference between #collect and #map, or did I just mean to use #each?

Eventually I started to get more comfortable with being **uncomfortable**. I stopped slapping myself on the wrist when I turned to google. Even if I kept looking up the same piece of information dozens of times, I had to remind myself that "anyone can code." The knowledge wasn't in the syntax (though I can't deny that knowing the syntax speeds up the process A LOT); it was in how the pieces fit together.

Advice from a beginner

I'd like to share a few lessons that I had to learn the hard way.

1. It is okay to not know something.
2. Use your resources often.
3. Ask for help.
4. It will get easier.
5. Anyone can code!
