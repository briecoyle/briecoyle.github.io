Just as every recipe needs that one super-secret, special ingredient to take it over the top, a splash of jQuery can go a long way when it comes to a basic Rails application. Single page applications are the "It" thing nowadays, and rightfully they should be. For speedy interactability 


P.S. Try adding a little malt vinegar to your grits. You won't be sorry.
