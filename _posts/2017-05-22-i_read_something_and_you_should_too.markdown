I stumbled across [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://poignant.guide/) as a pull quote in [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/). I was intrigued by the sentiment as it is written:

> “And my heart glows bright red under my filmy, translucent skin and they have to administer 10cc of JavaScript to get me to come back. (I respond well to toxins in the blood.) Man, that stuff will kick the peaches right out your gills!”
—_why, Why’s (Poignant) Guide to Ruby

Having spent the last month or so forcing JavaScript to fit into the beautiful fluted mold of Ruby, I had experienced the toxicity of JavaScript's excessive bracket and parenthetical use. I spent the past weekend rejuvenating with Why's (Poignant) Guide to Ruby. It truly was poignant. Despite being 10 years out of date (Version 1.9.3 ... how cute!), I thought that \_why's description of mixins were some of the clearest I've read. 

I know I'm late to the party, but I wanted other late party-goers to join in the fun too!
