When Blackboard, Whipple-Hill, or Moodle are getting you down, turn to **Classroom Manager**. **Classroom manager.** is built using Ruby on Rails and allows teacher to organize their classes based on ability levels, essentially building differentiated instruction into the scaffold of the LMS.

### *1) Brainstorming the Rails Portfolio Project*

> **Completion of the Learn Curriculum**
> **Productive (?) procrastination**
> **$100 and a valid email address**
> **Deep seeded frustration in the tools associated with one's current occupation**

When you first reach the Rails Portfolio Project, you will notice that you have a half dozen unwatched lectures in the Learn curriculum. Before starting to write any code, but after reading the requirements at least twice, procrastinate by watching lectures about object orientation, authentication, and authorization. Spend $100 on Rails tutorials and literature. Sign up for 3 email courses about blogging. Reread the portfolio project requirements. Decide to incorporate model testing in your project and code-along with setting up a rails project that utilizes rspec testing. Oops, you've begun. Title your code-along project Classroom Manager because you accidentally ended up as a highschool biology teacher at your alma mater. 

### *2) Initializing a Git repository*

> **Terminal**

> **Atom text editor**
