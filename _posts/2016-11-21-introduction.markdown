It was summer. After barely surviving my first year of teaching biology to ninth graders, I was looking for a way to make each day a little more livable during Year Number Two. Instead of soaking up rays on the dock, I was feverishly researching gamification. I was already tired of repeating myself four times a day and worrying that I had forgotten to mention that one specific extra detail to the last period of the day. So, at this point, I had started to flip my classroom. I recorded my lectures and assigned short instructional videos as homework. It was a hit with the students, and it made each period of the day exciting and unique. I was able to spend more time with each student individually, get to know them, and try to appeal to their distinct learning style. However, I still wasn't able to personalize each students' learning plan as thoroughly as I'd like.

This was what brought me to coding. I had a grand plan to structure each lesson around experience points, allowing each student to gain experience through different activities, videos, practice worksheets, and labs. Students would be able to choose their activities, and as they moved through the material, they would unlock more options. Unfortunately, my school did not have a very robust Learning Management System (LMS) and I was at a loss of how to implement all of the great ideas I was gaining from conferences and lectures about gamification in the classroom. So, I decided that I would just make it.

I'd just *make* this huge, impressive learning system for my students, and I would be teacher of the year! I had 2 months. No sweat. Piece of cake.

I started to poke around free resources for coding on the internet. I dabbled in several different languages, investigated multiple different platforms. There were programs that boasted quick turnarounds, but I felt like they either were too simple or lacked the support system that I needed. I stumbled across Learn.co through an advertisement on an iPhone platformer game. Instantly, I was hooked. I lost sight of my original goal. The shelf dedicated to the "World's #1 Teacher!" award gathered dust while I embraced iterations and variables and ruby-doc.org. 

August smacked me in the face like a jilted Real World: Challenge contestant on the party bus home. I had not made it. Year Number Two was not destined to be easier than Year Number One. I settled for a fully flipped classroom with OneNote integration. As the school year started, I realized that I was still drawn to my coding lessons. I filled free moments with Codecademy and Chris Pine's *Learn to Program*. It was official. I was in love.
